# Voat Enhancement Suite

Voat Enhancement Suite (or VES) is an alpha userscript designed to enhance the user experience of Voat.co.

## Introduction

Voat.co is in alpha development. Many features provided by Reddit Enhancement Suite are already built in to the site's user experience, however there are some features not included (keyboard navigation, new comment highlighting, &c). This script is intended to add those features eventually.

A few things:

+ intended features, as I determine them, are added within `TODO` lines in the userscript source. I'm open to expanding the capabilities of VES, and contributions by users are more than welcome.
+ please *do not* use this script unless you are willing to troubleshoot for yourself when issues arrise. If you determine a solution to the issue, please inform me so that I may include it in a troubleshooting guide.

Regardless of VES performance, I hope you enjoy the functionalities VES will provide.

Thank you!
